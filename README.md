# AD CS Security Documentation

This repository contains several documents that provide an in-depth look at Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), including key concepts, documented attack paths (ESCs), common references, and acknowledgments ("Shoutouts") for those who contributed to the knowledge base. Below is an overview of each file in the repository along with links for easy navigation.
Work in progress!

## File Overview

- **[Key_Concepts.md](Key_Concepts.md)**  
  Outlines the core principles and essential concepts behind AD CS, such as its role as an internal PKI, integration with Active Directory, certificate templates, and more.

- **[Attack_Paths.md](Attack_Paths.md)**  
  Summarizes the documented Enterprise Security Configurations (ESCs) that represent various attack paths in AD CS. It covers scenarios like poorly configured templates, abuse of enrollment agents, and NTLM relay attacks.

- **[Common_References.md](Common_References.md)**  
  Compiles key references and resources used to build the documentation, including official Microsoft documentation and research materials from SpecterOps.

- **[Shoutouts.md](Shoutouts.md)**  
  Provides acknowledgments and shoutouts to the individuals, teams, and projects whose work has contributed to the content of this documentation.

## How to Use
Review the files in sequence to gain a comprehensive understanding of AD CS security:
1. Start with **[Key_Concepts.md](Key_Concepts.md)** to familiarize yourself with the foundational aspects of AD CS.
2. Proceed to **[Attack_Paths.md](Attack_Paths.md)** to learn about specific attack vectors and how misconfigurations can be exploited.
3. Refer to **[Common_References.md](Common_References.md)** for additional context and in-depth technical details from external resources.
4. Check **[Shoutouts.md](Shoutouts.md)** for acknowledgments and recognition of contributors in the security research community.

This structured approach is intended to aid security professionals and IT administrators in understanding and mitigating risks associated with AD CS.
